        <h2>Once in Color: A Life Fading to Gray</h2>

        <p>
            There was a time when everything felt alive — the sky was impossibly blue, every sound had its own melody, and even the wind seemed to whisper promises. But that was a long time ago.
        </p>

        <h3>Chapter 1: Childhood in Color</h3>
        <p>
            As a child, he believed in everything. Every small thing had meaning: a broken crayon still had life, puddles were oceans, and the future felt infinite. He ran barefoot under the rain and laughed without reason. His world was painted in bold, saturated colors.
        </p>
        <p>
            But even then, he was different. Always daydreaming. Always losing focus. Teachers said he was lazy. Others called him “slow.” No one saw the noise inside his head — the spinning thoughts, the buzzing distractions. Back then, there was no word for it. Just labels.
        </p>

        <h3>Chapter 2: The Vanishing Contrast</h3>
        <p>
            Years passed, and the magic began to bleed out of things. Colors dimmed. His excitement faded into obligation. The world grew louder, yet more silent — like being in a crowd where no one speaks your language.
        </p>
        <p>
            He wasn’t rich. Far from it. Every day felt like survival. The kind of poverty that makes you tired of choosing between food and dignity. And still, there was no one. No real friend. Not even someone to say “you’re not alone.”
        </p>

        <h3>Chapter 3: ADHD, But Not Diagnosed</h2>
            <p>
                He never got diagnosed. There was no time, no money, no safety net. But he knew — something inside him never stopped spinning. He couldn’t hold onto tasks. Couldn’t sleep when he needed to. Forgot the most basic things. Yet remembered a thousand unrelated facts.
            </p>
            <p>
                He wasn’t broken, but he felt like he was. Everyone else seemed to be moving forward — career, family, goals. He was still... stuck. Watching time. Watching life pass like a train he could never catch.
            </p>

            <h3>Chapter 4: Chasing What?</h3>
            <p>
                The worst part wasn’t being lost. It was not knowing what he was even chasing. Success? Peace? Recognition? He didn’t know. Maybe just silence. Maybe just a sense of “enough.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Every night, he stared at the ceiling, wondering why nothing felt right anymore. He had hobbies, interests, little joys — but they all felt muted. Like he was living behind a fogged-up glass wall, touching life but never feeling it.
            </p>

            <h3>Chapter 5: Gray</h3>
            <p>
                And now, everything is gray. Not black. Not white. Just... gray. Emotions don’t hit the same. Laughter feels distant. Hope feels like a memory from someone else's story.
            </p>
            <p>
                He walks through life with headphones in, not because of music — but to drown out the world. Because silence is sometimes too loud, and his own thoughts are louder still.
            </p>

            <h3>Chapter 6: Still Here</h3>
            <p>
                But he wakes up. Every day. Still here. Still breathing. And sometimes, in rare moments, he catches a glimpse — a sliver of color. In a song. In an old smell. In the way light hits a corner of his room. And in those moments, maybe… just maybe… the gray is not forever.
            </p>
